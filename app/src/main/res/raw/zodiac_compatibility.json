            "love_description": "Romantic relations between Aquarius and Aries can be rather successful if their partnership is based on mutual devotion and interests, otherwise, conflicts are inevitable. The headstrong nature of these two signs can put them at odds when it comes to love because Aquarius is the symbol of the water bearer and wants to revolutionize and change the world for the better while Aries, like the ram, has a tendency to butt-heads and fight. Aquarius does admire the fiery temperament of Aries, their readiness to act and achieve goals: Aries, in turn, respects the sharp intelligence and uniqueness of their partner.\nWhen it comes to sexual intimacy, these two signs tend to have no bounds. Both are interested in expressing their passion and won’t shy away from kinky exploration in the bedroom. They are the ones that will try out sexual fantasies with each other, they never thought they would have the opportunity to try! Generally speaking, the friendship between these two signs is a much wiser choice compared to love. Although sexual chemistry is strong, the relationship aspect outside the bedroom can be tense because of their strong personalities.",
            "values_description": "Communication of these two signs can be interesting and delightful for both sides. As Aquarius is the air element and Aries is the fire element, these two will feed off of each other when it comes to spirited conversations and debates. However, the headstrong fixed nature of Aquarius will clash with the cardinal mode of Aries when their views do not coincide. They may have very different ideas, especially when it comes to freedom. Freedom is an essential part of Aquarius’ Uranian nature. This sign is rather flexible but will never betray themselves and will always follow their own path. As for Aries, since theirs is the first sign of the zodiac and they are ruled by the impulsive Mars they will push to lead and get their Aquarius partner to fulfill all of their wishes. They might feel slighted by the fact that their partner does not always operate in their fast-paced time frame. Subconsciously, Aries would like to take total possession of Aquarius, which is not possible for the Aquarius to submit to, this can make them discontented and unhappy as a couple.",
            "overall_description": "Patron planets of Aquarius are the planet of Karma, Saturn and the planet of rebellion, Uranus, which endows this sign with responsibility, social awareness, and progressive views. Aries is under the influence of passionate and fiery Mars and therefore they are famous for their assertiveness and determination. When these two signs combine energy it can be explosive, very exciting, and at times unpredictable.",

And even if they fall in love, their mutual infatuation and affection usually won’t last long once the novelty wears off. Aquarius cannot live without freedom and independence, their nature is like air and water, which always finds a way to escape. As for Taurus, this sign is famous for its earthy possessiveness, need for security and stability. Taurus will be able to provide Aquarius with a more grounded sense of reality and tend to the comfort and environmental needs of the pair, creating a nice atmosphere, and homelike space for them. When it comes to sex they both need to be willing to see the other person’s perspective in order to make sex pleasurable and enjoyable. The tense dynamic can lead to an interesting exploration of power dynamics, who is on top, etc. Overall, Aquarius and Taurus can form a harmonic match as long as they are open to compromises and experimentation in the sexual sphere.",
            "values_description": "This couple has a good chance to be happy together if they are ready to accept their differences and respect each other’s opinions without attempts to change them. Their fixed modality makes it so both signs will not budge on their point of view or opinions very easily. This typically makes for an ‘agree to disagree’ approach within this partnership. Both of them are independent individuals able to compose a harmonic match, though it will take a lot of effort from both of them. They are well-matched in the values of the fixed signs which include intense dedication, tenacity, and perseverance against all odds. One of their main differences is that Taurus likes to live in their bodies and is highly concerned with the comforts of the physical world while Aquarius lives in the mind and is more focused on cerebral, imaginative, and intellectual matters in life.",
            "overall_description": "Aquarians are strongly influenced by the disciplined energy of their ruling planet Saturn while Taurus is under the soft feminine impact of Venus, the planet of attraction and love. These signs have quite different attitudes towards life but a very fixed modality, which puts them in a square aspect within the zodiacal wheel. This can make the relationship highly dynamic and growth-oriented, with the opportunity to enrich each other’s lives with their unique viewpoints. Aquarius will teach Taurus how to stand out from the crowd by being uniquely determined, disciplined and goal-oriented: Taurus, in their turn, will acquaint Aquarius with the delights of hedonism as their earthy element allows.",

No wonder that Gemini can fall in love with this sign very easily. Their sex life often has no boundaries as both will be happy to explore the erotic with each other. These signs like to experiment and are eager to know each other’s souls and bodies. Together they can generate an all-consuming passion for each other and this flame can burn for a long time. Aquarius will tend to take the dominant role in relationships and has a set approach to the sexual and emotional bond which can be a great balance for the chameleon-like and mutable Gemini, who won’t mind giving in to their more assertive partner’s whims and desires. These two will never run out of things to talk about or do, and will always find ways to keep the sexual relationship interesting, spontaneous, affectionate, and loving. If other factors in the chart align, this is a match that is complementary and meant to last!",

Spontaneous and generous Aquarius likes to surprise their partner and is ready to give Gemini anything they want, whatever the cost. They are highly creative in their relations with friends and loved ones. The only thing Aquarius will never sacrifice is their freedom, but Gemini loves freedom as well so this is a match that can work if both people can settle long enough to keep it going. Aquarius is a fixed modality sign but remains somewhat flexible and eccentric due to their air element which can keep Gemini from getting bored over the long haul. Inventing new ways to bond and develop new interests together is a great strength of this partnership. As a zodiac sign ruled by Saturn and Uranus, personal evolution and constant self-development is a value Aquarius people hold dear, which will motivate their Gemini partners to bring out their best sides, while Gemini can help Aquarius remember to relax and go with the flow.",

Aquarius is famous for their openness, tolerance, and desire to serve humanity while Gemini tends to analyze, think and generate new ideas. These two signs are definitely able to enrich each other, as the combination of their strong cerebral focus and intellectualization of emotions forms a harmonized alliance. When both signs are of the same element, as in this case, the match has a much better chance of working out as both friends and lovers.",

Being a fixed air sign ruled by Saturn, Aquarius trusts logic, facts, and wisdom while Cancer, a cardinal water sign ruled by the Moon, usually follows intuition and tends to believe strongly in unseen and spiritual energy, which Aquarius would like some proof for. Contradictions of this kind are too deep to be ignored and rather hard to overcome for this pair, especially in a romantic situation. When it comes to sex and intimacy Cancer needs a deeply emotional bond that Aquarius is too detached from to provide. Sex for Aquarius is typically seen as a social, pleasant, and more playful part of life while Cancer takes a much more serious tone to being in love or having sex. In addition, the cardinal quality of Cancer is too dominant and forward in bed for Aquarius’ tastes and usual preference to be the lead. There will be conflicts over who is initiating in love and sex, creating disagreements within the bond.",

Both are signs that like to give of themselves, just in different ways. With Cancer, being a water sign, they like to give by nurturing and providing to others on a personal level while Aquarius likes to give back to society on a larger scale through social activism and altruism based on their communicative and social air element. These two signs also have a very different take on emotions and how to display them. The highly emotive and heart-centered Cancer will be too much and somewhat overwhelming for the more objective and airy Aquarius. As friends and work colleagues they will be able to make each other laugh, if not only from the point of view that one finds the other one’s beliefs and thoughts ridiculous or humorous — but this sense of light-heartedness towards each other can actually help them get along when the situation calls for it!",

Aquarius is not overly emotive and often appears detached or aloof while Cancer is highly emotional and extremely sensitive which can create mismatched chemistry between these two signs. Relations of a Cancer and Aquarius are often fraught with arguments and misunderstandings because they are both coming from very different mindsets and wildly different approaches to life.",

On the other hand, both signs have trouble really getting to the heart of their inner emotions and revealing their deepest feelings, which means neither will be opening up in this case. In sex, their sexual chemistry can be truly intense, often beginning as a palpable sexual tension that builds between them over time. The pressure of the fixed modality of both signs bottling up their emotions has to find a way to come out at some point!

They often feel united and stronger when together, able to show off the best sides of themselves. Leo is a fire sign that compliments Aquarius’ air element very nicely and makes these signs fast-paced and quick conversationalists. In addition, the combination of fire and air along with their fixed mindsets creates a dynamic that can lead these signs to truly enjoy each other’s company, complete with sarcastic and witty conversations and interactions. They make the best of friends, which is often the preferable way for an Aquarius to start off a long term or romantic partnership. As opposite signs in the zodiac, they both tend to share some of the same shadows, pride, being one of them. This can be an area of life that creates a unique bond and a deep understanding of how each one wants to show up in the world as knowledgeable and respected.",

The personality traits of these two signs greatly complement one another: Aquarius’ love of freedom and individualism in combination with Leo’s assertiveness and a strong sense of self can create a dynamic duo! Both of these signs are opposite on the zodiacal wheel, meaning they are like two different sides of the same coin and are more similar than they may seem at first glance.",

Open discussion, which should be easy for these two air signs, can help them overcome any challenges if they arise.

            "love_description": "It is hard to predict the probability of harmonic love relations between Aquarius and Scorpio. On one side, their chances are low, as Aquarius needs freedom and will not tolerate any boundaries enforced by Scorpio, who is famous for their possessive nature. However, Aquarius may be intrigued by their jealous counterpart and try to make the relationship work for a time. They are both fixed signs, which is harmonious while their water and air elements can make them a mismatch, but this can lead them to open up to exploring boundaries and sexual fantasies with one another. Both are extremely private about their emotions, desires, and personal motivations. If they are willing to build trust over time, they will be able to feel safe, secure, and free within the partnership to share their deepest thoughts and erotic desires without fear of judgment. Hurdles in the intimacy department may arise if Scorpio becomes too controlling over Aquarius’ body, mind, or time. Aquarius will be all too quick to leave if they feel overburdened by the needs, desires, and possessiveness of their partner. Overall, this is an interesting and mysterious love match, to say the least.",
            "values_description": "As two fixed signs in a dynamic square aspect to each other in the zodiac, It may seem that these two signs were created to be permanent antagonists because they are both so determined to fight for their principles and views. Unfortunately, most of their values do not coincide, as a result, a great part of their communication might be devoted to quarrels, debates, and biting conversations. Being a water sign Scorpio deeply tunes into the emotional undercurrents of the world while the air nature of Aquarius can see the bigger picture and how information, people, and society all fit together. They will be able to unite over their interests in psychology, social issues, and a general dislike of authority and social hierarchies. The energy between them can lead to a powerful friendship alliance and even successful business partners with the right approach.",
            "overall_description": "Aquarius is ruled by Saturn and Uranus while Scorpio is directed by Mars and Pluto, which means these signs have a complex way of being in the world. Each with two planetary rulers, this implies an inner battle between one’s contradictions and an ultimate goal to reconcile and balance these energies. This theme will bleed over into the partnership, creating an opportunity for growth and evolution. Interaction of these two signs can be rather fruitful if Aquarius can make fiery and impulsive Scorpio be a little more patient and tolerant in uncontrollable situations. Scorpio, in their turn, might add some passion and flame in the calmer emotional attitude of their airy mate.",

This is one of the rare occasions where Aquarius will be a little laxer and loose with their body, mind, and soul, allowing the warmth, optimism, and passion of Sagittarius to lead them into love. In time their mutual admiration, devotion, and respect only grow. Sex can become a one-up match between them. Sagittarius, as the sign of the wild centaur, tends to be lustful, generous, and spirited in bed while Aquarius wants to show off how eccentric, kinky, and experienced they are in sex. Overall, their intimate life is usually active, delightful, and not possessive or jealous. The fixed and objective Aquarius may feel at times that Sagittarius is being too over the top for them or coming on too strong, but a quick conversation and open discussion can solve the matter with ease. Their goal is to keep the emotional bond strong and not let their longing for freedom get in the way of their happiness together.",

The extreme honesty of both signs, due to a combination of being socially-minded because of their air and fire elements blend well together. The mutable or changeable energy of Sagittarius will be able to bring spontaneity to the relationship that the more fixed mode energy of Aquarius can stand to tolerate.",

These two will seem to have a lot in common, and in the vast majority of cases, the alliance of these signs is extremely useful for both of them. Things can work out well for this partnership in almost all areas of life, especially romantically or as the best of friends.",

Aquarius is an ardent rebel and may feel locked down by Capricorn’s bossy, cardinal attempt to control the relationship. They both are outward focusing, paying attention to creating meaning and having a sense of purpose, however, this can serve as a distraction for them when it comes to romance and love. Capricorn has an earthy sensuality and a high sex drive that does not always match up with Aquarius’ more refined sexual tastes. The symbol for Capricorn is the sea-goat, demonstrating the receptive and sensitive need to connect on a physical level while Aquarius is the symbol of the water bearer and tends to place more importance on life outside the bedroom. When they do find time for sex and intimacy the connection can be quite unique, as neither of these signs will shy away from the taboo if the timing feels right. Overall, this is a strange love, a little weird and offbeat, but maybe that is exactly what these two signs need from time to time!",

The cardinal modality of Capricorn means they will constantly be trying to assert their needs and wants in the relationship which may clash with the steadfast and resolute attitude of the fixed Aquarius. Neither will be very open to compromise as they will feel that is a lose-lose situation as opposed to a win-win. Although both these signs deeply respect each other, contradictions are inevitable, as Aquarius cannot imagine their life without freedom, and Capricorn thinks that boundaries are necessary for keeping life in order. Their attempts to convince each other can make the situation even more complicated. However, they have some common values: for example, they both adore fidelity and place a high priority on having integrity and holding others, including each other, to very high standards.",

Saturn inspires hard-work and dedication towards a chosen goal which both of these signs seem to possess. On the other hand, Aquarius is ruled by Uranus as well, which adds a wild card to this mix that is hard for tradition-loving Capricorn to overlook. Aquarius can be more in touch with Saturn or more with Uranus depending on their placement within the birth chart. This will strongly impact and determine the probability of success or failure within this partnership. Aquarius and Capricorn tend to make better friends than lovers, but a long-lasting love match is not entirely out of the question!",

Surprisingly, these two unconventional loving types, tend to channel Saturn when they get together in love, preferring a more traditional relationship structure and bond. Sex can be fulfilling for them both, although, they may not have that much of it together.

Aquarius often pushes the boundaries of conventional thinking: their mind travels far. Other people sometimes do not understand their dreams and plans, therefore two Aquarians together will have a mutual trust and understanding of each other.

            "love_description": "As lovers, Pisces and Gemini tend to discover they are a mismatch. Pisces is a hopeless romantic, sensitive, and has a deep longing for a relationship that transcends all bounds while Gemini is not that magnanimous towards love and treats relationships as friendships as opposed to life-altering romances. Their placement in the zodiac puts them in a square aspect with each other, which means there is potential to learn a lot from each other and possibly a karmic draw to be together for a time. After lessons are learned these two will tend to part ways on good terms and maybe will remain good friends. In bed things can feel a little off, Gemini, being an air sign, moves too quick and spontaneously in sex for the slow, sensual, and connecting water energy of Pisces. The strong influence of Neptune on Pisces makes it so they have sex for true love based on feelings. Gemini, in turn, does not need an emotional basis to get pleasure from sex. This difference in perception can be a challenge to overcome in the long run.",
            "values_description": "Being under the mutable modality makes both of these signs greatly value independence and freedom. Pisces absolutely must be able to live the life they dream of and Gemini, in turn, does everything they can to be true to themselves. In addition, being mutable signs can make them more tolerant of others, therefore their views and attitudes can differ but it does not disturb them. They do have a strong uniting factor – their love for creativity and imagination. As a water sign, Pisces is deeply in tune with emotions and often has the soul of an artist while Gemini likes to come up with new and exciting ideas they can share with their Pisces counterpart. Even if they perceive something differently they respect each other like two talented artists, speaking one language.",
            "overall_description": "Overall these signs tend to be a strange match. Gemini is like a butterfly, flitting from one thing to the next while Pisces is more slow-moving, in a dazy dream. Both may seem like they have their heads in the clouds at times but in completely different ways, making it hard for them to find common ground. Pisces is ruled by Neptune which inspires dreams and fantasy along with Jupiter which stimulates Pisces’ desire for knowledge and spiritual transcendence making them a kind of dreamy philosopher. On the other hand, Gemini is ruled by Mercury, the information and details oriented planet of communication. They crave constant learning and movement, lightning-fast conversation, and quickly jump from idea to idea.",

They can enjoy sex only if it is ripe with emotional attachment and spiritual closeness. The only problem they can come across is Cancer’s conventionalism in the sphere of sex, whereas Pisces rejects any boundaries and loves to experiment in bed. Therefore one of the partners can feel unsatisfied if they are not able to find a compromise. Their sexual chemistry will be very compatible as both of them are water signs, which implies they take a similar approach to connecting in body and soul. Relationships between these two are very supportive, open, and loving. If disagreements arise this can feel extremely devastating for this pair and may take a while to repair the damage or broken trust. They are highly sensitive together and are always looking out for each other’s feelings. This is a partnership that is meant to last a lifetime.",

For example, you can find these signs in the helping professions, nursing careers, and as caregivers. They are naturally compassionate and believe in providing support to others. Communication, can, however, be an issue for these two. With Cancer being a cardinal sign, their communication style is more direct and straightforward, and even more pushy to some degree while Pisces being a mutable and water sign tends to communicate more with body language, facial expressions, and feelings. Pisces often have a hard time describing their feelings or frustrations as they get confused and overwhelmed due to their ruling planets, Jupiter which expands issues and Neptune which disorients. Cancer will be able to use their strong intuition to better connect and support their Pisces partner.",

They compliment each other perfectly and will play into each other’s need for dependence on one another. The ruling planet of Cancer is the Moon, which inspires the dreamy Neptunian Pisces to get to know Cancer more deeply. The Moon is associated with emotions, inner feelings, and mystery. Neptune is also associated with mystery along with spirituality and imagination which blends perfectly with Cancer’s nostalgia and longing. Alliance of these two signs is likely to be successful, as they literally read each other’s thoughts and feelings. However, Cancer should remember to give Pisces their space, as the sign of the fish they want to be able to move and flow with life-based on their own whims and wishy-washy desires.",

If arguments arise Leo will try to win Pisces back with material gifts and Pisces will not be impressed by this action. As a mutable water sign, they want to feel their way and emotionally reconnect to save the bond and will find gifts rather shallow at that point. In general, these signs differ so much, they tend to not even end up as lovers in the first place. Abrupt Leo tends to do things that are highly irritating for sensitive Pisces, such as undermining their beliefs or destroying their dreams. The one thing they have going for them is that Leo is a very loyal partner being of the fixed modality, and Pisces needs someone they can feel secure and devoted to.",

Pisces, being a water sign is deeply in touch with their emotions and experiences life with the depth of an ocean, Leo, on the other hand, is a fire sign and therefore experiences life fraught with competition, like a game waiting to be won. For this reason, Leo will not be able to fulfill Pisces’ deepest longing, to connect and merge with another person because Leo is more focused on maintaining a sense of individuality and identity. Both of these signs greatly value creativity and tend to have immense talent in the spheres of entertainment and the arts. As a mutable sign, If things go awry in the partnership, Pisces will tend to disappear without a word as they don’t have the focus to sort out what went wrong.",

Jupiter favors a deep longing for knowledge while Neptune inspires fantasy, creativity, and dreams. The Sun is famous for its vitalizing energy, assertiveness, and concentration on the Self. Brought together these two signs can either contradict each other or complement each other’s virtues. Pisces is able to soften Leo’s character: Leo, in turn, can help Pisces to be more determined in translating dreams into action. The fixed nature of Leo may be too stubborn for mutable, non-judgemental, and easy-going Pisces, which may cause conflict in the long run.",

If they want to maintain harmonic relations they will need to work on unconditional acceptance of each other. Virgo is the stronger communicator of the pair and will help guide the way in this regard.

These two signs are also both mutable, meaning they operate with a similar energy level and speed. Virgo and Pisces like to experience life on their terms, not too rushed, but not too slow.

This can leave Pisces feeling misunderstood and Libra stressed about keeping the peace. However, mutual admiration for each other can help them work through their differences in communication if they are truly dedicated to each other. When it comes to sex, there is a tendency for Libra’s airy emotional detachment to not display the depth that Pisces is looking for in a mate.

            "love_description": "A love relationship between a Pisces and Sagittarius is dynamic and sometimes contentious. As a water sign, Pisces are hopeless romantics and unconditionally generous lovers. For them to have a proper relationship, they need to have a profound connection with their partners. A Sagittarius, on the other hand, only reveals their emotions at the surface level often without much forethought and therefore can come across as offensive at times. The fire energy of Sagittarius is what brings the spice to the relationship. Their love of wanderlust and travel blends well with Pisces’ desire to blend and merge with the whole of the universe, this makes them both dreamers in their own way. Close communication between them has a tendency of awakening emotional feelings they were not previously aware of. A Sagittarius and Pisces could have a very active sexual relationship if they manage to hit it off. Pisces will show Sagittarius how to be more romantic and loving in the bedroom while Sagittarius will show Pisces how to be more primal and physical. Together, they have the chance to deepen and broaden their sexual experiences in life, they will just need to work on being sensitive towards each other’s unique personalities to make it all work!",
            "values_description": "One of the stark differences between Sagittarius and Pisces is that the latter is prone to outbursts of emotions while the former expresses emotions in a much more blunt and straightforward way. As a water sign, Pisces has an emotional and sensitive aura around them and treads lightly in situations, preferring to read a room’s energy and is interested in being empathic and supportive. Sagittarius as a fire sign will be energetic and action-oriented, they will be less concerned with other people’s feelings and more invested in getting their point of view across to others. These contrasting values make them very different but also allow each one to learn something very profound from the other one. As two mutable signs they love to have a sense of flexibility and changeability: this often leads them into escapist types of activities and interests together. They also value other intelligent individuals as well as people with good hearts and diverse perspectives about life. They both feel like outsiders and appreciate this fact about each other.",
            "overall_description": "These signs seldom have a physical or emotional relationship, but when they do, it is fire. Their optimistic nature coupled with the spiritedness of Sagittarius is sure to bring a lot of laughter and creativity to the bedroom. Both signs are ruled by the same planet, Jupiter which makes them deeply attracted to each other on a spiritual and soul level. They will want to know each other inside and out and this relationship can feel karmic in nature. As two signs in a square aspect on the zodiacal wheel, they are ready to learn lessons from each other, each bringing their unique philosophy and take on life into the partnership. They are both prone to overthinking and over-expectations from the other.",

Aquarius has a love of rational thinking and rejects overly emotional perspectives. For this reason, Aquarius has no desire to be a container for Pisces emotions or to express their own feelings. Under such conditions, it is nearly impossible for romance to develop. In sex and intimacy, these two also take different approaches, although, both will be open to experimentation together. The mix of the air and water elements tends to bring up some awkward situations in the bedroom as air represents detachment, verbal communication, and equal exchange, while water represents receptivity, sensing, and emotional depth, they tend not to blend well. In addition, Aquarius is an active or yang sign that wants to push for their own experience while more subdued Pisces is a yin sign, and will constantly be waiting for Aquarius to meet their sexual needs.",

At times Pisces, being a water sign and ruled by Neptune, means they will have trouble identifying specific emotions or knowing what they are feeling is coming from them or somewhere else. This will trouble and frustrate the structured mind and modality of the Aquarius. They do, however, share views regarding human values, high ideals, creativity, freedom, and innovation. However, Pisces prefers watching rather than acting according to their beliefs, in contrast with Aquarius. Together, they have the opportunity to show each other a different way of being, and might even learn a lot from each other if they can open up to their differences.",

Jupiter and Neptune inspire spiritual research, philosophical thinking, and craving for knowledge. Uranus is responsible for innovations and generating ideas and projects. Saturn is associated with public life, and determination: necessary for realizing Uranus’ projects. When Pisces and Aquarius come together they have all the chances to create a harmonic union, full of mutual admiration, respect, and cooperation as friends and business partners, however, they tend to be a mismatch when it comes to love. They are both innovators in their own way, which will initially pique their interest in each other, but their emotional and spiritual differences will make it difficult for them to find common ground.",

Two Pisces individuals understand and respect each other, keeping distance when it is necessary and giving support when the partner needs it.\nTheir relationships often remain platonic, but if sex happens, it can be really wonderful, as these two personalities are able to perceive each other’s desires without words. They often become drawn to each other by the watery emotional depth of their characters. This can create an intimate and very private bond between the two. Sex will be loving, soft, and receptive with each partner giving attentiveness and care to the other’s pleasure and sexual experience. The Neptunian influence of spirituality will also urge Pisces individuals together to explore the spiritual dimension of each other’s sexuality and unlock the mystery of each other’s inner passions.",

With Neptune as a ruling planet, Pisces is often drawn to the arts, music, film, and photography and these two will have a lot in common in this regard, while also inspiring each other’s creative pursuits and endeavors. However, as both of these signs like to live as artists in society and really hate to operate within the social structures available, they may find it difficult for both of them to pursue their passions at the same time.

However, there will be a tendency for one to wait for the other one to make a move. Pisces is ruled by Jupiter, the planet of expansion and Neptune, the planet of fantasy.

The ability to know each other's needs, moods and feelings unlike any other sign is what makes this love connection so exciting. It’s a bittersweet combination of the highest highs and lowest lows.

Both of their zodiac animal symbols, the ram for Aries and the bull for Taurus, show their tendency to butt-heads and dig their heels in to get their way. Aries is usually strong-willed while Taurus-borns find change difficult and are utterly loyal to their partners. This may be hard for an Aries to understand, as they have a more loose approach when it comes to relationship boundaries and definitions.

This is also a hot and fiery relationship because both signs can be preoccupied with who is in charge. Aries is a yang cardinal sign, which implies their desire to be on top — both literally and figuratively. If these signs can learn to put their selfishness aside, their relationship would flourish without a doubt. When it comes to sex, they create explosive passion. Both partners are able to turn up the heat in the bedroom. Emotionally they are well-matched, without overly sensitive displays but still passionately dynamic, open, direct, and sincerely honest. They cannot stand for mind games and will always be straightforward and upfront with their needs and desires, especially when it comes to sex and intimacy.",

Leo is a fixed sign, which means they are set in their ways and value loyalty, which can sometimes clash with the experience-driven Aries. However, both signs love a good time and will be able to provide each other with the fiery energy the other one needs to stay interested in the relationship overall. Both signs can lack patience and be outrightly proud as their animal symbols would imply, with Leo being a lion and Aries being a virile ram! Leo likes to be adored and appreciated, and Aries is hardly interested in feeding Leo’s Ego. Aries is definitely going to have a huge problem with Leo’s natural flirtatious nature, and this is one of the things that would keep this relationship exciting and thrilling! These signs usually just get each other— Aries, representing aggressive energy which is ruled by Mars, and Leo representing the self which is governed by the Sun.",

However, both signs have enormous egos that are likely to get in the way of this relationship.

With Leo is being ruled by the Sun and Aries is ruled by Mars, both planets ignite and stir up drama and excitement. In addition, Leo and Aries are fire signs which means they make for a highly compatible pair and a really strong team. In this relationship, there's a constant battle to see who is in charge, who's boss and this usually results in hot makeup sex. This connection is a dynamic duo of passion and raw desire.",

Virgo, as a sign of service, has deep compassion for helping others, and they will often want to be in a relationship with an Aries if only to mold them to their ways. Aries will not be able to submit to Virgo’s whims and expectations as Aries needs independence and space to spread out and be their wild self. While Aries has a natural charm and passion, a Virgo would serve as a graceful partner, often shocked by Aries’ displays of dramatic behaviors. This fire and earth combo will definitely be able to have some raunchy sex if only to release all of that sexual tension they build up through arguing.

This makes them well-matched as they both concern themselves with the values of Mars: survival, instincts, and drive. Aries is a risk-taker and a hard worker, and this combines powerfully with Scorpio's creative ability.

They are more experimental than most couples and don’t mind playing around with power dynamics in the bedroom. Aries will be fascinated by Capricorn’s often private wily nature in sex and wonder why they are not more out in the open. As Aries is the archetype of self and identity they will be mystified at Capricorn’s strange take on love and relating, and their need to define boundaries and set limits, which will only work to stress out freedom-loving Aries. So whereas the sex can be good, a relationship is unlikely to go the distance in this case.

Being a fire sign, Aries is more energetic and will balance well with the mental and emotional stability that Capricorn embodies as an earth sign. An Aries may not realize that Capricorn can be indirectly in charge because of their ability to steadily work towards their goals. Capricorn will have a tendency to let their goat-like stubbornness butt up against the pushy ram energy of Aries. This can create some dynamism that is both fascinating and very powerful.

As a zodiac sign ruled by Neptune, Pisces often is lost in romantic fantasies and even delusions about their relationships. Aries, being blunt and straightforward, will bring Pisces right back down to reality whether they like it or not. Pisces is not able to give Aries the passion that they need to stay interested in a relationship, and Aries will often think the watery Pisces is too gentle and soft with them when it comes to sex. Pisces will allow Aries to be the leader in this relationship, which, a cardinal sign like Aries will expect. Both signs will have to do some negotiation from time to time to ensure equilibrium. Aries is a highly physical sign and pushy with boundaries, this energy can feel too dominant and controlling for this peace-loving sign of the fish.",

Aries is easily understood by Pisces, with their intuitive ability to understand other signs. The water of Pisces either puts out, dims the fire or evaporates the fire of Aries! But when their energies are appropriately channeled, they can help each other. Aries can teach Pisces to be a risk-taker, and Pisces can teach Aries to relax and pay attention to the feelings of others. Both of these signs value their self-expression and identities just in very different ways, Pisces wants to merge and understand the experience of all living creatures while Aries is focused more on the self and sensing themselves in contrast to others. This mismatch may make it difficult for the two to find common interests and mutual understanding.",

In addition, they are right next to each other on the zodiacal wheel, therefore, the energy could not be more different.",

Libra being an air sign may not show enough physical connection for the earth sign of Taurus. The erotic Venus rules these two signs but the cardinal Libra has a longing for amusement and communication while Taurus is stoic and prefers to be at home. With a little adaptability and nuance, these two can work out their differences. Sex between them is fine but not spectacular, often they can satisfy each other but they often never are able to find their cadence in the bedroom. They both enjoy a grand lifestyle, love, and romance, but sometimes things don't come out quite right. An emotional attachment is missing in this partnership, Libra seems removed most of the time from the deeper connection Taurus is trying to build.",

The energy can feel mismatched at times when it comes to business and relationships as both feel they are on different wavelengths. These two will find mutual respect for each other’s tastes in art, aesthetics, and music and especially love pleasure and indulgences as being under the influence of Venus. When these two get together they will appreciate and tolerate each other’s desire to sleep in, eat lots of sweets, take vacations, and all around enjoy life’s little pleasures. This is something that can either harm or help them in the relationship, as there is the chance that both will encourage the other to indulge in their vices too often. Both take pride in their outward appearance and will bond, especially as friends, over style and wardrobe choices.",

However, Taurus appreciates the Venusian qualities of simple beauty, craftsmanship, and the grit of the earth while Libra appreciates refined beauty, elegance, and glamour. Taurus is often very resolute in their mindset and cannot understand why Libras struggles to make up their minds. As an air sign, symbolized by the scales, Libra likes to weigh their options and often floats somewhere in the middle.",

Sagittarius needs time to think about getting into a long-lasting commitment, but that is all Taurus is after, making freedom-loving Sag feel stifled. Taurus, as the symbol of the grounded bull, is unlikely to give Sagittarius the leeway they need to be themselves. While Sagittarius as the symbol of the centaur will tend to run right over Taurus’ desires and dreams. When it comes to sex and intimacy these signs can get on okay. Taurus as a negative or receptive sign will like the action-oriented and yang expression that Sagittarius brings to the bedroom. In addition, both partners appreciate the unique beauty and will know how to pleasure each other erotically. They are well balanced as Sagittarius, being a fire sign is electrifying in their sexuality while Taurus, as an earth sign appreciates slow sensuality and pleasure.

Their ruling planets, Jupiter with Sagittarius and Venus with Taurus indicate some understanding between each other, as these two planets are complimentary. Jupiter is the higher expression of Venus and both are associated with fortune, money, and abundance. Therefore, the Sagittarius-Taurus pair stand to make a lot of money together. Some self-control and temperance for each other are two significant things that could help in nurturing their relationship, but it's absence results in low compatibility.",

As Sagittarius is a fire sign and Taurus is an earth sign there can be moments when their energy levels will not match. Taurus may feel Sagittarius moves too quickly in conversation and in life at times. On the other hand, Sagittarius may feel impatient with Taurus’ need to take their time and go through life with a conscientious and thoughtful presence.",

In addition, Aquarius as an active, positive sign, therefore pushes their ideas and dominance in the relationship while Taurus as a receptive sign tends to be less able to vocalize and share what they want and desire in love and sex. Aquarius moves quickly while Taurus moves slow, which can make for a mismatch in their sex life. The earthy sensuality of Taurus often cannot find the detached Aquarius sexual energy attractive.

Aquarius has trouble grasping that Taurus needs to feel comfortable physically and emotionally, and sometimes does not feel great about themselves if everything is not in its proper place in their life. Taurus thinks very differently from Aquarius and being honest with each other can lead to further confusion and misunderstanding. If Aquarius wants to build love with a Taurus, they have to let go of their self-righteous attitude and be concerned with their partner's feelings.

It's clear that Gemini needs Taurus to help them focus and not act on impulse all the time! In sex, the air and earth element of these signs tends to be a mismatch. Taurus is too slow for Gemini’s witty and often talkative approach to sex. Gemini wants a partner who will match them in friendship and pace, unfortunately, Taurus is overly focused on romance and sensual connection. They each are able to be sweet to each other, and neither will be mean or vindictive in any way. This couple, if things don’t work out in the long run, will tend to stay best friends.",

Gemini needs a partner that will let them run free and be open to flirt and socialize with others, Taurus, as an earth sign is more possessive and won’t want to give in to Gemini’s wishes. Gemini takes on life from an intellectual stance which differs from Taurus who is more slow, relaxed, quiet and peaceful in their approach. Therefore, Gemini sees Taurus as too dull and Taurus may view Gemini as lacking in practical abilities. Although, Gemini can help Taurus have some fun as life does not always need to be that serious. Also, the Taurus well help the trickster Gemini to be a lot more focused and grounded.",

Gemini is a mutable air sign, meaning they are playful, curious, and unpredictable while Taurus is a fixed earth sign, meaning they grounded, reserved, and mindful. The ruling planets Venus and Mercury, however, will help the two find common ground. Venus helps out with social situations, which Taurus often finds stressful, and Mercury is associated with communication, therefore the Gemini partner will want to constantly be conversing and socializing with others.",

A mysterious nature underlies this partnership as they can sense a depth within each other that they find hard to open up to others about.

Gemini wants to be constantly engaged with others and entertained by facts, information, and media but Scorpio tends to be more reserved and often likes to spend time alone to collect their thoughts and think about life. This can make Gemini feel unloved and lead them to cheat or seek out another partner more suitable to their needs. These signs can incorporate intellect and emotion in their union, but it will require both signs to put their backs into it. They would need to work hard to keep this relationship, especially if they fall in love. Gemini can be a bit shallow and needs to understand that if they want to connect with their Scorpio lover, they need to get in touch with their feelings. Sex is average with these two. Scorpio will excite and intrigue Gemini, especially at first. While Scorpio will like to direct and lead in sex. The fixed stubbornness of Scorpio mixed with the mutable energy of Gemini means they will bring different but complementary sexualities to the bedroom.",
            "values_description": "Gemini loves to get into debates, sending their brain into overdrive, and this normally frustrates the Scorpio who can keep their wits about them no matter how dramatic the crisis. Being a fixed sign, they are more resolute, and will usually look down on Gemini’s love of freedom and flitting from thing to thing, however, they will respect them deeply for wanting to be true to themselves. Gemini is also very flirtatious, and Scorpio almost can't stand this, because Scorpio is usually very possessive of their partner. This relationship is never dull, considering the disparities between both signs. When Scorpio lets their Martian anger flare-up, this can upset Gemini, who will never be able to understand how someone can get so intense towards life's ups and downs.",
            "overall_description": "Scorpio and Gemini are quite a pair. Most of the time Scorpio, being ruled by Mars and Pluto, will be too intense for social and light-hearted Gemini. The elements of these signs, air for Gemini and water for Scorpio means that Gemini is working more with the mind while Scorpio is working more with emotions, finding common ground can be difficult.",

They both invite change, traveling, and boundless exploration of each other’s minds and ideas. At times, Gemini may feel overpowered by Sagittarius’ fiery and often temperamental personality. Sex is explosive for them, hot and spicey. In bed, they like to test each other’s boundaries, with Sagittiuars being the fire sign and the symbol of the centaur they have a higher sex drive. While Gemini, the symbol of the twins, is more enigmatic and fluid with their partner in bed. Their loyalty towards each other will tend to be loose as neither sign wants to be tied down, which is just perfect for them. The mutual understanding regarding boundaries and how they want to define relationships helps this pair stay steady for a long time.",

Their ruling planets are very complementary and reflective of each other. Mercury, the ruler of Gemini, represents learning, the mind, and information while Jupiter, ruler of Sagittarius, represents the higher mind, consciousness, and expansion.

Gemini can connect with Sagittarius on the basis of adventure and independence, and this union will hardly see fights because of the ability of both signs to deal with issues among them. The air element of Gemini is associated with the mind while the fire element of Sagittarius is associated with spirit and energy, these two will fuel each other’s passion for learning, exploring, and traveling.",

Trust will be an issue in this relationship because Gemini barely has a stable mind which won't sit well for steady minded Capricorn. Both signs will need to maintain boundaries because even their ruling planets (Mercury and Saturn respectively) only further pull them apart. As the sign of the goat, Capricorn wants to have earthy and raunchy sex. Gemini may or may not be into this, but will try almost anything at least once! Like other areas of life, their sexual tastes will differ but they may try out a short term fling for the novelty of it. Gemini is highly curious and will want to get to know why Capricorn is the way they are. In a relationship they ask their partner a lot of questions about themselves, demonstrating they care and are interested, which Capricorn will appreciate. After some time though, Gemini, being mutable and airy will need to find a partner that is a better match for their interests, energy level, and sex drive.

As a cardinal sign, Capricorn wants to push their agenda and expectations on Gemini but Gemini being a mutable sign, will laugh this off, preferring not to take Capricorn's demands seriously. When it comes to mutual interests, they are able to find some things in common, for example, gaining knowledge and wisdom are important to both signs, however, Capricorn will take a methodical and thorough approach while Gemini takes in lots of little bites and media snacks.

This couple needs to learn to work with each other one step at a time if they intend to overcome the obstacles that will arise in their relationship. They definitely make better friends because they can match each other in wit and humor, Capricorn is quick to relegate Gemini to the friend zone.",

This mixture blends to create a creative and imaginative couple that finds they value many of the same things but with highly different attitudes. Gemini is definitely more laid back even to a fault at times while Aquarius is more rigid and intensified in the duo. Aquarius, being a fixed sign, can help Gemini remain focused and balanced and Gemini, being a mutable sign, can keep Aquarius’ spirits up.

Sex for them is magical, glamorous, and even bizarre at times. Pisces finds they lose themselves in sex and Gemini goes along for this transcendental ride, and loves it!

Their decisions as a pair are usually more solid than as individuals being a combination of an air sign and a water sign.

Gemini, ruled by Mercury, is intellectual and loves to talk: Pisces, ruled by Neptune, has a more idealistic view of the world and can be helped by their Gemini partner to have a more fact-based perspective.

Cancer, as the safety loving crab, does not appreciate this sense of non-realism and has trouble believing anything their Gemini counterpart says or does. Sex for these two is a blend of sugar and spice. Cancer is gentle, sweet, and affectionate while Gemini is agile, nimble, and playful. These two can have fun together, if Cancer can relax and if Gemini can stay invested long enough to make it to this phase of the relationship. Over time, these two will find they are not able to give each other what the other one needs for long term love.",
            "values_description": "Gemini and Cancer tend to value very different things in life. For one, Cancer is ruled by the Moon, which represents feminine energy, mysteries, emotions, and sometimes spiritual matters while Gemini is ruled by Mercury, which represents information, neutrality, messages, and conversation. Both signs tend to mirror their ruling planets very accurately. In partnership, there tends to be a mismatch in their communications and energy levels. Gemini gets bored easily and is constantly in search of stimulation while Cancer doesn’t mind a stable routine and enjoys taking life at a slower, less hectic pace because they tend to worry a lot and a busy life only makes this worse for them.",
            "overall_description": "The two signs lie side by side in the zodiac, though they do not share much. Cancer desires to be accepted and appreciated while Gemini enjoys a life full of energy, activities, and spice. To stay together, they need to make deliberate efforts and put in work and understanding to be able to complement each other. Their compatibility is relatively low. Cancer is a cardinal water sign, which means they lead with their hearts and emotions while Gemini is a mutable air sign which means they flow in the moment and stay focused on what they are thinking. Cancer needs someone they can open up to and be completely honest with. Gemini is often unable to sit still long enough to really hear Cancer out.",

This energy combined with Cancer’s watery need to feel secure makes it so two Cancers together are constantly worrying and doing everything they can to stabilize and solidify their life together. They can fall in love deeply and will do almost anything that is necessary to make their union work. When it comes to sex and intimacy these two will find their stride. As receptive, yin signs they like to take in each other’s sexual energy and build trust through sex. Their bond grows deeply over time and is highly considerate, tender, and often very intimate. Cancer is a softy for romantic gestures and loves love. They will worship each other and shower each other with gifts and affection. Their moody nature is the only thing that can get in the way, therefore, both should be willing to give the other one space when necessary for a lasting relationship!",

When they think about their partner or potential partner, long term potential is what comes to mind. This symbol of the crab seeks out people who will stay in their lives for the long haul. They don’t want fairweather friends or lovers for that matter! They value stability, security, and want the vulnerability they experience when getting to know someone to not be taken for granted or not be worth it in the end if things don’t work out. As water signs, their emotions are real and run deeply. And with the Moon as the ruling planet, the possibility of high emotional drama is likely. These two should watch out at the Full Moon because tension is heightened and both will be feeling antsy and energetic. Cancer values nurturing and sensitivity, therefore, sharing and understanding each other will bring a great deal of satisfaction.",

So when two Cancers get together it can be a beautiful thing! As cardinal signs, this means their sign starts off one of the 4 major seasons and therefore represents initiating and leading energy. Together, they have a lot to give each other, they are both very attentive and caring which will dominate the relationship and lead to an understanding and deeply emotional connection. As two water signs together, there is a lot of moodiness to go around, Cancers together will need to be patient with each other and keep their moods in check at times in order to keep the peace between them! But overall, they are harmonious, supportive, and an excellent match!",

Leo, being a fire, positive sign, wants someone to share experiences with, travel with, and be friends with while Cancer being water, negative sign, wants someone to build a home with, settle down with, and emotionally connect to. Cancer will never be able to feel totally secure with their Leo partner, as Leo is charming and flirtatious making Cancer always feel jealous or unstable within the partnership. Leo likes to be the center of attention, and although Cancer loves to provide for others, they will not always feel emotionally up for giving so much of themselves. This sign of the crab needs a lot of time to recharge and rest in order to maintain social interactions. When it comes to sex and intimacy, Cancer and Leo don’t tend to like each other very much. Although both are generous lovers, they have trouble feeling passionate towards one another and sex will most likely fall flat.",

Leo, being a fire sign, is passionate and temperamental, while Cancer being a water sign, is sensitive and moody. Together this makes for a lot of personality in one couple! They can have serious issues when trying to make their needs known, and often get upset with each other because of all of the heightened emotion. In addition, Leo, the lion, can be domineering to Cancer’s crab-like nature, and Cancer will often feel they have to retreat and hide from Leo’s often theatrical emotional outbursts. However, these signs are extremely generous and giving, they both are associated with the chest area of the body, Leo the heart and Cancer the breasts: which is where the heart chakra of affection, empathy, and emotional connection is.",

The Sun represents the self, is the center of the solar system, and provides the light that illuminates the lunar surface. Leo too is able to light up and energize the personality of the Cancer. These two make much better friends or business partners than they do lovers. Cancer is a cardinal sign, which means they put energy toward their beliefs and convictions while Leo is a fixed sign which means they absolutely want things to go their way. These two often find it hard to reach a common ground as their priorities differ and they are adamant about how things should go.",

Virgo may take a while to put their faith in their partner, but Cancer has enough calm and patience for their partner to build confidence in them. Therefore, both signs stay cautious of dishonesty and deception, and their love connection remains topnotch. Though they may be genuinely in love, their minds still work separately: Virgo, ruled by Mercury, is much more cerebral and information processing while Cancer, ruled by the Moon is much more intuitive and empathic. Sex, between an earth and water sign, is incredible. Both are sensual lovers, attentive, and deeply aware of pleasing their partner.

Cancer’s cardinal, or self-focused energy, and watery nature is sometimes a lot for rational Virgo to handle, however, they will accept their Cancer partner for who they are. Virgo is a mutable sign which means they are changeable, and therefore they are able to be more flexible than their Cancer partner. This going with the flow attitude will help keep the peace and balance between these two signs. Together, they find a deep emotional bond, amazing conversations, and many common interests.

They have different wants and are psychologically different. If they could be patient with each other, there's a high possibility of the relationship working out. Both signs find they appreciate beautiful art, good food, and enjoying themselves: which doesn’t make it hard to find things to do together. But the biggest area of common ground for these two signs is being in a relationship. Cancer feels most secure in life when they have a partner who understands and supports them, while Libra, the sign associated with partnership, relationships, and balance, wants nothing more than to constantly be with others. Intimacy between them may work out okay. Cancer will have a higher sex drive and need it more often to feel secure within the partnership.

Libra tends to take more risks in life, as a positive sign, and therefore sometimes feels held back by Cancer’s more cautious energy. Cancer, on the other hand, will dislike how Libra wants to be out in the world socializing. Libra needs the affection and support for their self-confidence boost, so they love to be in groups. Cancer, on the other hand, prefers spending time with their immediate family and friends. They cherish private time. It is priceless to them. Their interests do not appeal to their partners.

Their efforts towards maintaining the partnership are well-matched with their cardinal energy. Together they are able to find a soul connection, and as receptive signs keep many of their deepest feelings just between the two of them. Capricorn and Cancer are homebodies and create a private world at home full of creativity and learning, often having a huge library and collections together. The sexual relationship between Capricorn and Cancer is one of the extreme ecstasies! When earth and water signs come together they can be assured that they will enjoy a long-lasting relationship with mind-blowing orgasms! These signs understand sensuality, the body, and pleasure. They are each other’s muse and both like to give and receive in sex in perfect, raunchy harmony.",

The Cancer sign is generally more emotional as a water sign than the Capricorn sign which results in prolonged time spent on understanding each other's differences. Trust is possibly this couple's strongest suit as they care deeply for integrity and honesty. Although they are not good at trusting others, they have no inhibitions when it comes to their partner. These two are cardinal signs, which means they like to start things off and put effort towards launching their dreams into reality. The connection happens on a realistic as well as an emotional level for this couple. Their bond becomes intense and they find they can be completely comfortable and be themselves, which is a great relief to these two self-conscious signs.",
            "overall_description": "These two signs have one thing in common which is that they both dwell on the past. Capricorn is ruled by Saturn the planet of karma while Cancer is ruled by the Moon which is connected to ancestry, history, homeland, and family. As believers of the karmic cycle, both signs are cautious of their past actions as well as the future ones. A good thing from that thought process is that it helps the Cancer and Capricorn couple to avoid trouble as much as they can. This kind of precaution is perfect for a euphoric relationship which is what these signs can have together.",

            "love_description": "When it comes to love, these two possess so much energy that it can be expelled through intense sexual activities. However, they will find their chemistry is often a mismatch. Cancer, with the spirit of the Moon, wants feelings, romance, and sensitivity. They want to explore the deeper meaning in life and bond on a heart-level. Aquarius, with the spirit of Uranus, wants rebellion, eccentricity, and analysis. Because of this, they can feel like it is really difficult to relate to one another. When in a relationship it is hard to give each other what the other one needs. The protective crab symbol of Cancer finds it hard to build intimacy with Aquarius, the symbol of the water-bearer, who is too active and outward-focused for them. Sex is odd for these two. Cancer wants eye contact and connection, Aquarius wants to try new things and express themselves without emotional complication. In the end, they find sex for them is as strange as their relationship together, and they likely will want to part separate ways.",

Cancer will love to tell their partner about all that happened during their day while Aquarius will be stressed just by having to tell their partner about their day. This makes Cancer feel like they're lying or they do not care, which can cause the trust factor to be on edge. As a fixed sign, Aquarius will find their stubborn point of view does not mesh with Cancer’s leading, cardinal energy. Both will feel right and justified in their pursuits, desires, and personalities with neither one being able to make a compromise in this case. Aquarius is too rational for emotive Cancer who takes everything to heart and gets hurt easily.",

Cancer, as a water sign, has to control their emotions while Aquarius, as an air sign, would focus on entertaining and productive activities. Their ruling planets don’t tend to get along either, both expressing very different energy expressions of the human psyche. Cancer is ruled by the Moon and therefore deeply in touch with what is happening within on a personal level. They are often left feeling confused by Uranus ruled Aquarius who is more involved with the social and outer world.",

These water signs are so considerate of the other one, if they get into a disagreement, they will spend days trying to sort it out and get back into a peaceful dynamic again. Spirituality may be important for these signs and their mutual beliefs are often something that brings them together in the first place. However, over time their beliefs and views may differ greatly and grow apart. Sex for them is beautiful and sensual. Their sex drive may differ at times with Cancer needing more power behind their sex and Pisces wanting more subtle affection. They both feel free to desire to connect with their bodies, minds, and souls.

Imagination is strong between them and they find pleasure in daydreaming about the future and what life could be. Cancer values taking care of people as well as being taken care of. This makes Pisces a good match because they too, being a water sign, are concerned with the well-being of others. At times their energy will clash because each one has such a subjective take on life. Pisces’ nebulous mind can be hard for Cancer to read which can cause tension if they can’t figure each other out.",

The passion will definitely be there and sexual chemistry might be as well! But they find that once they have sex a few times and the tension has been released, they no longer find each other as interesting or attractive as before. Overall, they have pretty hot and action-oriented sex. Aries helps Capricorn be more daring and adventurous and is turned on by Capricorn’s sexual energy. Capricorn, in turn, is open to new sexual escapades and gets a thrill from exploring their wild side with Aries for a time. Intimacy is hard to build because Aries does not open up easily about their deeper feelings and Capricorn needs to know someone is all in before they put their heart on the line. One good thing from a Capricorn-Aries relationship is that they bring unique qualities to the relationship which could be a learning ground for both parties.",

As cardinal signs, they both have extreme energy levels which tend to show up in the relationship. These two definitely push each other’s buttons! The tension that builds between them is intense and spirited. Capricorn and Aries often bond over having heated debates and discussions. Neither one is afraid to impress their views upon the other one. Aries is a risk-taker, but with a Capricorn in the picture, the risk-taking would be checked. Regardless of the level of the risks they are willing to take, they go all out when they have a goal to meet.",

Their relationship in the zodiac is a trine aspect, meaning harmony and balance is easily established with this pair. Since each one knows what they want, there can be times where one tries to overpower the other and Capricorn should be mindful of being too bossy and controlling in this partnership!

Gemini is much too whimsical in the bedroom and too laid-back for Capricorn, who wants more earthy and deeply passionate sex. This situation can turn out pretty awkward for both of them as they find the sexual chemistry is nearly non-existent. But they both can laugh it off and hopefully remain friends!

As a flexible air sign Gemini reaches goals by being curious and open to opportunities that come their way but Capricorn, being a leading earth sign, goes after the opportunities and does not wait for things to happen to them. They prefer to be in control of their destiny and Gemini is much more fluid, often leading to conflicts overall in this partnership. On the business side of things, they would be a better match.

Gemini, being a mutable air sign, loves humor and play which can either blend well with Capricorn’s salty personality or work against it.

Capricorn, ruled by Saturn, will never outright say they want to be appreciated, but deep inside, that's all they want. While Leo, being ruled by the Sun, will openly and willingly demand this of their partners. This can be a mismatch for them at times because one person is getting all the credit for the hard work of keeping this relationship stable. The sexual chemistry between them is interesting, to say the least. With the fiery fixed energy of Leo and the cardinal earth energy of Capricorn, these two could go all night. They find their rhythm in sex but don’t always feel the most pleasure out of it. They know when work needs to be done and do not mind being apart to focus on personal interests. They are the type that eventually becomes power couples if they stay together. For love between a Capricorn and Leo to thrive, there has to be a truckload of reassurance, to be sure they are still on the same page and one party is not already drifting. If they are, and channel their energies, they could be magic.",
            "values_description": "Together, these two are naturally tense and pressured. This can be either a good thing or a bad thing for compatibility. In some cases, there is just too much tension between the two, therefore they end up arguing or not getting along. At other times, they find the humor in their mutual uptightness and can get along much better. Leo, being of the fixed modality and Capricorn of the cardinal means they are both incredibly hardworking signs and value organization. Of course, Capricorn’s Saturnian nature leads them to be more conservative and reserved while Leo is more social and charming with a ruling planet light the brilliant Sun! Their mindsets tend to be singularly focused at times and it can be hard for one to actually hear the other one out. A certain synergy happens when Capricorn and Leo are together. Both channel such intense focus into the projects and work that they do, each one will understand the other’s workaholic tendencies. They achieve their dreams and often are there to support each other but not offer much intimacy.",
            "overall_description": "Capricorn is an earth sign, and Leo a fire sign which means this couple approaches life with very different energy signatures. Capricorn will be more calculating and melancholic while Leo is more spirited and temperamental. They tend to make much better friends, as this relationship structure gives them the chance to appreciate each other’s quirks rather than be irritated by them. Capricorn with a ruling planet like Saturn, which restricts, can never understand Leo’s never-ending desire for love, appreciation, and admiration. Capricorn will secretly like Leo’s enthusiasm for life while Leo, being a fixed sign, deeply respects Capricorn’s tenacity and perseverance.",

The earth signs tend to like commitment and more traditional relationship structures and it is no different when Virgo and Capricorn get together. With their realistic approach to life, they would do well when it comes to relationships. They do not let their emotions get the better part of them and are able to draw the line when common sense is required. Capricorn kick-starts ideas that Virgo is most likely to take over and run successfully. They are like an extension of each other not just dedicated to projects: they are equally committed. Sex tends to be the glue that keeps them together for the long haul. Capricorn deeply appreciates Virgo’s attentiveness in bed and Virgo loves that Capricorn is always up for having sex. As the sign of the virgin, Virgo often comes across as coy or not interested in sex, but it is quite the opposite! And they are a good match for the highly sex-driven Capricorn. Intimacy is able to grow with these two, Virgo won’t be willing to rush into bed too quickly, but will eventually and it will be worth the wait...Capricorn just needs to be patient!",

As much as they love beautiful things and love comfort, they are quite sensible when it comes to finances.

Virgo is the sign associated with Mercury, the planet which is known for being pragmatic and are the champions of communication while Capricorn maintains the cool-headed and hardworking energy under the rulership of Saturn. Although they are both of the earth element, Virgo tends to be more mentally focused because their ruling planet Mercury is associated with the mind. Therefore, Virgo is the one to keep conversations going and open the lines of communication. Capricorn appreciates this as they have a tendency to get lost in their own heads at times! Overall, these two find in each other the perfect partner. Their love will be strong and their intentions deeply sincere.",

On the other hand, Capricorn will be awe-inspired by Libra’s sense of aesthetics and art. Libra, as the symbol of the scales, is focused on balance and keeping the peace, taking things easy, and being overall casual in a partnership, but still dedicated. Capricorn, as the symbol of the goat, is climbing mountains and making moves, they often want their relationship with Libra to be stable, set, and defined. Libra is very social and flirtatious, which ends up leading to mistrust between the two. Arguments are likely and Libra is not interested in unpleasantness in their love affairs. At first, sex between them is spicey! Both are intrigued by the other one’s body, mind, and soul. They are invested in creating a pleasurable experience they both will remember. But the spark goes out after some time because the sexual chemistry just isn’t there. They tend to move from intimacy to familiarity all too quickly.

They may find it hard to balance their schedules when together because they like to do such different things. Libra’s appreciation of life might often be misconstrued as laziness when the focused Capricorn is involved. Libra represents beauty, a balanced life, ease, and refinement while Capricorn maintains a mindset of hard-work and mastery. Capricorn does not believe in sitting still when there is work to be done. So overall they have opposing work ethics.",

Sex for these two is beyond words. They are spiritual-minded lovers and end up in a sexual partnership explosive with passion and eroticism.

They tend to feed off of each other’s intensity, Scorpio’s being emotional and Capricorn’s being expectations.

Capricorn’s earth element makes them practical and thinks things through while Sagittarius’ fire element is expansive and optimistic. Capricorn needs Sagittarius’ spirited energy and can find it very inspiring in achieving their goals overall. Together they can find a middle ground, however, Capricorn will not understand Sagittarius’ need to always rebel and passionately fight authority as Capricorn often appreciates these hierarchy structures. With Sagittarius’ evaluations based on established knowledge, this can be the basis for Capricorn being informed and carrying out a project.

            "love_description": "A Capricorn-Pisces union is the classic case of seemingly opposites attracting and blossoming in love. The intuitive, emotional and fluid characteristics of Pisces find strength in their Capricorn partner, who appreciates authenticity and genuine self-expression. Together, Capricorn will need to take on many of the responsibilities in the relationship, and often is in the provider role as duty-bound Saturn would have it. Capricorn and Pisces are both signs that will sacrifice their own well-being to make a relationship work, therefore, they should both be aware of this and set clear, loving, and realistic boundaries at the start of the relationship. They typically have great sexual chemistry and find they are able to passionately and sensually express themselves with each other. Although, Pisces, being the sign of the fish, is sometimes too passive in bed for Capricorn, who typically likes their sex partners to have a little bit more fire and earthiness. Pisces, on the other hand, might be overwhelmed by Capricorn’s sexual energy and desire, finding it too overbearing and therefore the expectations on them to perform in bed too much pressure. Overall, sex is incredible though, dreamy at times, and romantic.",
            "values_description": "These signs create a harmonious aspect within the zodiac and share some similar characteristics. Both are receptive signs, as revealed by their elements of earth and water. Capricorn and Pisces are interested in knowing why life is the way it is. They both value deep conversations and are emotionally inspired by the arts and learning spiritual knowledge. Capricorn, as a cardinal side, needs to remember to not be too controlling or take advantage of Pisces’ sensitivity. Pisces being a mutable sign, needs to remember to be more solidified in their opinions and boundaries when with Capricorn. They often make great friends or lovers because of their mutual respect for each other’s beliefs, goals, and aspirations.",
            "overall_description": "Capricorn is ruled by Saturn which is attributed with responsibility and extreme work ethic while Pisces is governed by both Jupiter and Neptune planets which are associated with philosophy and dreams. When the three planets come together, there is not only fairness and justice but also room for compassion. Pisces, being a water sign, shows there’s room for fluidity and good reliance on intuition while Capricorn being an earth sign can balance and root these energies to reality.",

The fire signs do tend to be unpredictable so predicting the outcome of this love match is a gamble, another thing these two signs love to do! Falling in love is often a risk they are willing to take and they find their energy is complementary most of the time. At times their energy levels can get in the way of building lasting intimacy. Leo as a fixed sign is able to stay focused and dedicated to the partnership with a wholesome sense of loyalty and need for trust. Aries is a cardinal fire sign and has trouble sitting still, and can’t be tied down for too long. Being able to commit is something they have to be ready in order to make this relationship work. Sex for them is like fireworks. They both run hot and have a ton of energy, so the sex is active, playful, and orgasmic. Reaching climax is the main event and both are not afraid to be vocal and loud in bed.

Leo is fixed and therefore knows what they want while Aries is a cardinal sign and starts things off for the pair. Together they are associated with leadership and dominance so deciding who is first and in control of this relationship is a constant issue. They value individualism, self-expression, and identity. Communication is something they could stand to work on! Aries is often blunt and can be offensive without meaning too while Leo will always say what is on their mind...thinking its for someone’s own good. Their powerful personalities need tenderness, desire, and submissiveness to make room for harmony.",

In addition, Leo comes across as more regal, being that their symbol is a lion, they like to be more poised and put together. While Aries, the ram, is impatient and excited, which sometimes gets on Leo’s nerves.",

This can lead to a clash in personalities that is hard for these two to overcome. When it comes to sex both of them tend to desire different things, with Taurus, being ruled by Venus wanting to be cuddled, loved, and caressed and Leo, being ruled by the Sun wanting to be passionate and fiery in bed. Intimacy between them is possible, as both enjoy romance and spending quality time with the person they love.

Leo prefers taking more risks and pursuing their individual creative interests while Taurus will be more cautious and do what they need to do to make money. A synergy of values occurs if both persons look deep into each other’s likes and dislikes to find common ground. Leo is ruled by the Sun and therefore personal creativity and soul purpose while Taurus is ruled by Venus and therefore is associated with beauty and refinement. This often matches them to be lovers of fine art, literature, good food, and merriment. They both like to enjoy themselves, with Leo being the more social of the two, but nonetheless will make space in the relationship for socializing and events.

This implies that a healthy relationship between these two is dependent on compromise, mutual respect, and lots of forgiveness.

Their relationship may be quite challenging because Virgo‟s choice-driven nature could feel unprotected by Leo’s fiery passions. Their approaches to the term ‘having a good time’ are different: hence, they must find common ground if they want to remain in a satisfactory relationship. Sex for them will be alright but not spectacular. Leo wants lots of attention in bed and Virgo is apt to give their partner special treatment, love, and pleasure: which is perfect.

In love, they will find this creates a unique common ground for them to play out their relationship desires and personalities. Libra as an air sign admires Leo’s fiery spirit and confidence, and Leo loves admiration so he will be pleased with this match. Their love life is usually filled with respect, and they would most likely try out new skill sets to make it better. Libra, as the balanced symbol of the scales, wants life to peaceful, beautiful, and enjoyable. Leo, more flamboyant wants life to be enjoyable as well, while also creative and a bit wild at times. They will be well matched in love as these traits tend to compliment one another. Sex between them is inspiring. Leo and Libra will be able to create a beautiful sexual energy between them. Libra, will pull from their cardinal or leading energy, while Leo will motivate them to enjoy the experience. Their energies complement each other and the relationship is very loving, charming, and romantic overall.",

Ruled by the Sun they are invested in self-development and expression of their authentic inner self to the outside world. Libra, on the other hand, ruled by Venus has slightly different values. For example, they value justice, peace, unity, and group dynamics - as opposed to Leo’s love for individual identity. Libras, as an air sign and with a love of balance, is indecisive and fastidious in nature, so most activities and skills would look good to them. Leo, being fixed, is much more precise and able to make strong decisions with great judgment and tact. This ends up being a great balance for these two in partnership. Libra helps Leo see another side of things and Leo helps motivate Libra.",

Both of these signs are in the active, positive category which means they project their energy and desires. In addition, Libra is an air sign and lends a steady sense of rational calm to fiery Leo. At times they present to the public as complete show-offs, especially when together, but to the parties of this reputable relationship, it is an undeterred balance of respect and strong personal identities that makes them so strong.",

Leo, as a fire sign, is a passionate lover, warm, while Scorpio, as a water sign, sees sex itself as a show of deep and pure emotions and bonding. Though a middle ground is hard to find between these extreme personalities, a love affair between them could be adventurous. Their stiff opinions, life choices, and attitude towards reality would spur them to understand each other’s needs. Building intimacy is where they may have a problem. Deep, emotional Scorpio will want to bond at a level that Leo, being as independent and individually minded as they are, has trouble with.

This is a feat that allows them to place values on each other as partners. Arguments are likely to arise at times due to their intense personalities and dynamics. Both relatively private about their emotions, Scorpio being a water sign feels deeply while Leo as a fire sign feels more expressive. They may find that they can easily push each other’s buttons and tend to irritate each other unwittingly with how they operate emotionally. Scorpio, the sign of the scorpion, might have a tendency to say something out of line and Leo will defend themselves at all costs.",

However, a clear foundation in this relationship could breed trust that would make room for the energy-driven transparent Leo and the direct and honest Scorpio. They make a square pattern in the zodiac to each other’s sign and therefore have a naturally tense relationship but also one poised for growth.",

At times they may feel like a sense of destiny is pulling them together. They are so similar and appreciate so many of the same things it can seem uncanny to them, falling in love will be easy. The best thing about their love life is the passion they share, as Leo would bring their inner fire as a sex drive while Sagittarius would keep the flames burning for the best sex and love experience. Fire signs have loud, wild, and often very passionate love affairs and sex. Sagittarius and Leo both will be intense and may argue at times, but are quick to discuss and talk it out.

Even as friends these two might find conflict as Sagittarius doesn’t like to be tied down or make set plans and Leo gets very hurt if plans are broken...no matter how tentative they may be.

Both may enjoy the chase but are not likely to see a bright future on their path of love. In the end, their sex life is easily boring to both partners as they may subconsciously drift emotionally and become less invested in the partnership. The chemistry between them is strange, when fire and earth get together it is like lava but cools off quick.

Capricorn as a cardinal earth sign is invested in being low key but successful has quiet resolve, and a pressurized personality while Leo as a fire sign, is invested in showing-off, getting public recognition, and outgoing social interactions. Though the energy-driven Leo is not much of a planner, the ability of their Capricorn partners to weigh decisions makes them smart in business together. Leo appreciates open-hearted and direct people and may judge the preference of a Capricorn partner who is more careful with emotions.",

If they can compromise and work things out they have the opportunity for a deeply profound connection! Sex for them is dynamic and exhilarating. As a fire and air sign together they ignite each other’s passion. Aries as the symbol of the ram will be more forward in bed while Libra ruled by Venus will appreciate foreplay and a little bit more tenderness from their fiery partner.

Alternatively, Aries must be careful to give Libra time to express themselves: otherwise, the magnetism that attracted them in the first place might turn into mutual repulsion. In general, these two value similar things, as positive signs they tend to like socializing and being outgoing. They are interested in fulfilling their dreams and carving out a sense of personal identity and self-expression.

Both signs are looking for someone to sweep them off their feet. These two will drive each other crazy with Libra as an air sign having an appetite for entertainment and conversation which may be stifled by the Taurus’ contentment with home and hearth as an earth sign. Taurus will care for emotions and tenderness in a sexual relationship while Libra will rely most on good timing, this will make it hard for this couple to understand each other and they could end up seeming too needy to one another. However, they will never fight as Taurus and Libra are both peace-keepers. With a little flexibility and subtlety, these two partners can make their relationship last. Sex for them is where they are able to express their love of allure and charm. Both bring sexiness to the relationship that can be a real turn-on for each other. At times earthy Taurus will seem too raunchy for graceful Libra...but secretly Libra likes it.",

Together they want true, magical, mystical love but Taurus values tenderness while Libra likes responsibility and seriousness. However, their financial goals are the same. Taurus is a fixed sign and will work extremely hard for what they desire. Libra on the other hand, as a cardinal air sign, will like things to be easier for them. They will still take their goals seriously but they need to balance hard work with more rest and pleasure than their Taurus counterpart. Overall, they value living a life of beauty, surrounded by art and tastefully chosen belongings. They tend to make better lovers than friends.",

However, enough understanding can build a relationship they both desire. Elementally they are very different, so they will express their Venus-ruled energy in opposite ways. Libra, an air sign, will be more refined and elegant in their expression while earth sign Taurus will be more rooted and rugged.",

They both enjoy a sense of security in their bond and willingly compromise and adjust in different situations to make their relationship more comfortable. When the mutable, or flexible fire energy of Sagittarius gets in bed with a Libra sparks fly. They find they are perfectly matched in sex and in love. Libra will be able to temper and focus the wild passions of Sagittarius for a steamy sexual experience between them. Their desire and sex drive may be mismatched at times with Libra wanting more date nights and time for emotional connection, being ruled by Venus and an air sign. Sagittarius may want more time in the bedroom much more often than Libra wants to bond through sex. Either way, this is a partnership that can work, they are different enough to keep things interesting, but similar enough to maintain a strong partnership!",

Libra doesn’t seem like a creative person to others, but a Sagittarius sees their intellect through communication and motivates them to show their warmth. This leads to shared value of an intellectual understanding that gives them room to build their shared philosophy. As the symbol of the centaur, Sagittarius is up for an adventure and ready to take Libra along for the ride. Libra will be deeply intrigued and excited by this partnership. Their cardinal energy will win out over their need to keep things ordered and in line and they will be swept up by their Sagittarius partner. Together they value knowledge, being social, and out-going. They can connect over their desire to be out in the world, making friends constantly, and being able to relate to others. In addition, they both want life to be less-pressured and value free-time as much as time spent on career advancements.",

Sagittarius, as a fire sign ruled by Jupiter, is quirky and seen most times as wild while Libra, an air sign ruled by Venus, is sensible, calm, and gets hurt more easily. However, because of their bond, they tend to make up soon after without much fight.",

However, Capricorn's tendency to subdue emotions until deeply evoked makes for a poor partner choice for a Libra who seeks attachment and approval. With Capricorn hiding their feelings, this leads to a similar trend with the Libra which makes for a relationship without feelings or emotions. In bed, sex can be dynamic but chemistry will be lacking overall. Libra doesn’t appreciate Capricorn’s earthy approach to sex and finds them too invested in the physical part of the intimate relationship. Libra thinks it is more important to bond through a mental connection and only then follow that with a physical connection. Love for them will be a karmic experience, pulling them together for a brief time to learn lessons, and then when they are ready to separate ways they will have gained something they did not have prior to each other.",

Libra is more focused on visual aesthetics, making friends, and being social: therefore will find Capricorn’s disciplined and education-focused life not very fun or interesting. Libra would rather learn from others than books! In addition, their work ethics differ dramatically.

This love match is not easy for either partner, besides any usual relationship problems. This partnership has a lack of love and will always feel somewhat tense as these signs for a dynamic square aspect in the zodiac. Their desires will be at odds and their energy levels will cause disagreements, something Libra cannot and will not stand for.",

In addition, Libra will bring a synergy to the partnership that allows them to feel stable and secure within the partnership. As they both are objective communicators they're able to discuss difficult topics: such as jealousy and commitment without getting overly emotional or upset.

Aquarius, in turn, will channel their Uranian energy and help Libre achieve their highest ideals and aspirations in life.

These two are an extraordinary duo for standing up for social justice or radical change in the community. Aquarius is ruled by Saturn, the planet of karma and Uranus, the planet of rebellion while Libra is ruled by Venus the planet of attraction.

A Piscean needs regular doses of solitude, whereas the Libran cannot thrive without the admiration of others and socialization.

Unlike Taurus, Sagittarius is prone to temporary infatuations and platonic friendships, typical of the fire signs. Sex for them will be passionate but the emotional connection needed to keep a relationship going will be lacking.

Cancer, however, finds it more difficult to fall in love. It takes time for a Cancer-born to fall for someone and it takes an even longer time for them to trust and get comfortable. If love ever happens between these zodiacs, it is Sagittarius that falls first. Their energy levels will be entirely different but they will spark something in each other that can be rather fascinating. Cancer, as a cardinal water sign, will push Sagittarius to be more sensitive and emotive during sex, pressing for more romance and outward expressions of love. Sagittarius as a mutable fire sign will help Cancer be more adventurous in sex and experience a more wild sense of pleasure. The sign of the crab, Cancer, likes to retreat and rest, with their relationship being a safe haven to do this. On the other hand, Sagittarius the sign of the centaur doesn’t see this stark boundary between a private relationship at home and the outside world. These different approaches to building intimacy will make it hard for Cancer and Sagittarius to build a lasting relationship.",

Cancer is ruled by the Moon which makes them psychic, interested in what is hidden, and naturally moody. This usually leads to a mutual interest in having a love of knowledge and the pursuit of spiritual or philosophical exploration. Cancer, as a more humble water sign, values Sagittarius’ sense of personal pride and self-worthiness with confusion and Sagittarius cannot understand why Cancer does not have more confidence. Generally, they value different attributes in people around them. The ability of Sagittarius to react to events and situations spontaneously is fascinating to the Cancer. Their different modalities mean they express different energy for this lifetime. Sagittarius is a mutable sign and welcomes major shifts in their life and worldview while Cancer as a cardinal sign likes to exert more control over their everyday life and viewpoints.",

The insecure nature of Cancer will be unable to stomach the unstable nature of Sagittarius. It takes a long time for a Cancer to trust, and spontaneity unnerves and concerns them. Sagittarius is naturally good at seduction and is not a stable or faithful lover. Cancer requires a devoted lover and considers the flirty, philandering ways of Sagittarius unattractive. They both have a thirst for knowledge and forever seek new ways to improve themselves and those close to them. Being different elements, Sagittarius is fire and Cancer is water, their love for each other will never be proportionate.",

This means both Virgo and Sagittarius can bond over their love of learning, facts, and communication.

Scorpio as a water sign ruled by Pluto is searching for more of a soulmate, a deeper connection, and intense bond with someone they love.

They are both too focused on each other’s mental strength that building an emotional bond will become an afterthought. When these air and fire signs get together it will take a long while for both individuals to build enough emotions to remain stable in a relationship. A Sagittarius, as the sign of the centaur, will often change their mind and be unable to read what the more concealed Aquarius is thinking and feeling.\nAquarius, as a fixed sign, will tend to dislike Sagittarius’ constant mind changing. This couple is highly attracted to each other with magnetic sexual attraction. Both of them in a relationship like to experiment in the bedroom. Their sexual chemistry is a give in but they will both be unable to read this at the start of the relationship. Sagittarius and Aquarius will be putting off friend vibes at first and neither one will see this as the budding romance that it is! Together intimacy is built over shared vision and similar personalities while each one remaining uniquely themselves, eccentric, and a bit wild.",

They have their expectations for the relationship and they appreciate how vast each person imagines it. They are both optimistic in general with Sagittarius being the more positive one of the two. They value intelligent people with vision. Both of them also value honesty: something Aquarius has a particular interest in. They practically share the same views except when it comes to sharing feelings and emotions. An Aquarius is more objective while Sagittarius is more fiery and passionate.",

The mutable nature of a Sagittarius will make them get distracted with other things, while an Aquarius will find it difficult to move on as a fixed sign. The emotional link between these two will be highly consistent and they will find they have quite a bit in common...including really sporadic and highly individualistic energy.",

As a water sign, Pisces are hopeless romantics and unconditionally generous lovers. For them to have a proper relationship, they need to have a profound connection with their partners. A Sagittarius, on the other hand, only reveals their emotions at the surface level often without much forethought and therefore can come across as offensive at times. The fire energy of Sagittarius is what brings the spice to the relationship. Their love of wanderlust and travel blends well with Pisces’ desire to blend and merge with the whole of the universe, this makes them both dreamers in their own way. Close communication between them has a tendency of awakening emotional feelings they were not previously aware of. A Sagittarius and Pisces could have a very active sexual relationship if they manage to hit it off. Pisces will show Sagittarius how to be more romantic and loving in the bedroom while Sagittarius will show Pisces how to be more primal and physical. Together, they have the chance to deepen and broaden their sexual experiences in life, they will just need to work on being sensitive towards each other’s unique personalities to make it all work!",

As a water sign, Pisces has an emotional and sensitive aura around them and treads lightly in situations, preferring to read a room’s energy and is interested in being empathic and supportive. Sagittarius as a fire sign will be energetic and action-oriented, they will be less concerned with other people’s feelings and more invested in getting their point of view across to others. These contrasting values make them very different but also allow each one to learn something very profound from the other one. As two mutable signs they love to have a sense of flexibility and changeability: this often leads them into escapist types of activities and interests together. They also value other intelligent individuals as well as people with good hearts and diverse perspectives about life. They both feel like outsiders and appreciate this fact about each other.",
            "overall_description": "These signs seldom have a physical or emotional relationship, but when they do, it is fire. Their optimistic nature coupled with the spiritedness of Sagittarius is sure to bring a lot of laughter and creativity to the bedroom. Both signs are ruled by the same planet, Jupiter which makes them deeply attracted to each other on a spiritual and soul level. They will want to know each other inside and out and this relationship can feel karmic in nature. As two signs in a square aspect on the zodiacal wheel, they are ready to learn lessons from each other, each bringing their unique philosophy and take on life into the partnership. They are both prone to overthinking and over-expectations from the other.",

Their different energy levels make it hard for them to build a strong relationship. At times, Scorpio can be manipulative and therefore Gemini will feel their energy is dampened. Sex for them rarely works, as Gemini likes to be chatty and playful in bed while Scorpio wants to be deep and sensual. They find that neither one turns the other one on and sex tends to get pretty awkward with this pair. A satisfying relationship would play out when Gemini realizes they can bring intellectual stability along with a sense of ease into the relationship.

Since Scorpio is so intense, they will have to learn to move back at times to make Gemini feel secure and not controlled. These signs tend to value different things. Scorpio, ruled by Pluto, the planet of change and transformation, wants to evolve themselves and level up through understanding the deeper meaning of this world.

Virgo’s earthy subtle energy understands Scorpio’s watery, perspective perfectly. They prefer to work together rather than fight which makes them well matched for a relationship. At times Scorpio can be demanding but so can Virgo, if they can laugh off each other’s quirks and at times weirdness then this is a partnership that can work! The relationship is harmonious and well organized, and at times can feel a little strained from the pressure they both put on each other. Sex between a water and earth sign is satisfying and powerful. Virgo brings attentiveness and desires to please their partner while Scorpio brings a sensuous passion. It gets steamy and primal, as both signs are more introverted they let it all loose in sex. The best part of the relationship is that when they put their minds to things they can do anything and fulfill each other completely.",
            "values_description": "While Virgo wants life to be ordered and structured, Scorpio wants power, and it is easy for them to give each other what they want. Virgo is an earth sign while Scorpio is a water sign, these denser energies concern themselves with the material world. Therefore they both take a responsible role in securing resources, property, and finances. Virgo tends to be quieter and withdrawn from people, but Scorpio gives off an aura of mystery. Both are very intrigued by the other one’s quietness and find if they can open up that they have a lot to discuss, deep thoughts, and interesting perspectives. The duo can learn from each other and learn to meet in the middle of things. The Scorpio partner craves loyalty, and that is inherent in Virgo. Virgo is very straightforward, unlike Scorpio who is a very emotional sign and tends to hide this behind a wall, which Virgo is able to break down over time.",
            "overall_description": "The Scorpio-Virgo couple is similar in several ways. With elements like water and earth, they find their compatibility is high and they desire similar experiences in life. Virgo, as a mutable sign, is more flexible than Scorpio who is a fixed sign. Together they find their energies are well matched because Virgo likes to make sure their partner’s needs are always met and Scorpio likes being in a devoted and committed partnership. Both prefer to be home more than going out, therefore, they stay away from parties and crowds and have more time for bonding and strengthening the relationship. Together they have a perfect union.",

Their relationship could be very emotional and demanding, and it could make them obsessive about each other. Falling in love is rare for the Libra and Scorpio pair. For one Libra as a cardinal air sign is often out socializing and making new friends while Scorpio as a fixed water sign likes to spend their time with a few close friends and family. If they decide to make the relationship work each one will slowly try to transform their partner into their perfect vision, which may not be what the other person wants. This tension can build and allows for them a deeply karmic growth experience that neither one is prepared to undergo. Sex for them is active and a bit wild. Libra tends to let themselves loosen up for their more sexually driven Scorpio mate. Together, they can make this relationship work but will need to be ready to face their own personal shadows.",

So, the relationship is anything but boring as they each bring a lot to the table. The intensity of Scorpio and their sometimes more dominant energy is well met by Libra’s very rational and amicable approach. They both have charming personalities and are able to sway social influence with ease, Libra using charisma and Scorpio hypnotic emotional energy. Their differences lead to misunderstandings sometimes as Libra is upfront and honest and Scorpio is secretive and private. So, they often have to work on communication skills.",

Libra is ruled by Venus, the planet of attraction and love, while Scorpio is ruled by Mars, the planet of heat and fire. Libra cools and Scorpio ignites and these two feel like star-crossed lovers. As a water sign Scorpio gets moody but the Libras’ love for balance, as the symbol of the scales will help keep the Scorpio sane. Scorpio tends to balance out Libras’ weaknesses but is pushy toward their partner overall.",

Therefore, two Scorpios together are well matched as they won’t allow each other to be swayed and will be able to maintain their autonomy and individuality.

In addition, Scorpio thrives on intimacy, and they feel a sense of security when their partner opens up.

Scorpio has the tendency to fall hard emotionally until they get to the point of no return.

The fact that Capricorn is a cardinal sign will help get Scorpio to be less rigid and be more open to fun. When it comes to sex, Capricorn helps to maintain Scorpio's sexual needs.

They find they provide each other what the other one lacks in bed: Virgo to spice things up and Aries to slow down. They can make sex work but tend to lack chemistry in general. They need to rely on common interests and spend time doing what the other person wants in order to make this partnership last.",
            "values_description": "Virgo appears in control of their emotions and notices the details while Aires will leap into things without much forethought. This can cause some tension in the relationship, but secretly Virgo may enjoy this spontaneity. In general, though the couple has opposing energies and seems almost too polar to be in unison. The stable, grounded, energy that is Virgo is a far cry from the fiery, impulsive and dominant energy that Aries possesses. As it's often said that opposites attract, if both signs can look beyond their disparities, they will make a great couple: after all, Virgo can teach the fire sign, Aries, to be more stable and pay attention to the little things that count. Also, Aries can teach the mutable sign, Virgo, to be more loose-minded and not take life so seriously. Virgo can also teach Aries to value processes and hard work. Business is where they shine as bold Aries can bring the outgoing energy needed and Virgo keeps them on track.",
            "overall_description": "This pair initially seems like an unusual couple that should not be together at all but they can make fantastic friends and business partners, romantic relationships will require more work! As an earth sign, Virgo's natural calmness is not exactly a good match for fiery and aggressive Aries. Partners have an opportunity to learn from each other, making the relationship quite the experience for both signs. Aries is a cardinal sign which means they want to take the lead in this relationship and Virgo as a mutable sign will tend to appease their partner even if they are not happy about it. However, Virgo has a tendency to hold onto slights and will not forget this easily.",

Virgo, who likes to worship their partners, will give Taurus all of the attention that they want in bed. Virgo helps Taurus actualize their goals, and both signs have similar interests that make them a compatible couple. If the pair were to move in together or go out together, they could easily be viewed as the grounded and rooted couple with their natural ease and earthiness. Their relationship could be easily perceived as a perfect match if both signs can let their guard down just a little bit, and look past their trust issues. As the sign of the virgin, Virgo and the sign of the bull, Taurus finds each other in love a balance between ruggedness and refinement.

Their different modalities end up complimenting each other. With Virgo as a mutable sign they are more open and spontaneous which will help the more uptight and fixed sign of Taurus lighten up! On the downside, Taurus might have an issue with Virgo's natural criticism of almost everything! And judging by the fact that Taurus is naturally adamant, these two will have quite an exciting time together. Virgo will teach Taurus the ability to be flexible with their mind. In addition, Taurus is ruled by Venus, which makes this sign very likable and amicable, and therefore, Virgo will appreciate the natural niceties between them.",

The stabilizing energy of their element along with their mutual desire to get the most out of life demonstrates that these two have a lot in common.

Like all relationships, compromise is an essential factor. Virgo has a huge part to play in this partnership, providing steadiness every step of the way. Virgo and Gemini lack in sexual chemistry as earthy Virgo is much more physically minded then butterfly-like Gemini. In addition, Virgo, the symbol of the virgin, wants their partner to appear innocent, even if they are not, while Gemini is very much a flirt. Each one has a lesson to teach the other one and the relationship often has a karmic vibe to it.

However, as two mutable signs they both share a love of going with the flow to a point and tend to alter their personalities for the betterment of the group or others. They want things to be peaceful and harmonious most of all. Both signs value intelligence and are huge fans of resourcefulness. They have quite different approaches and views on intelligence but come to a meeting point at emotional intelligence. They also value the ability of someone to use their hands and imaginations as craftspeople, writers, artists, creators, etc. Both signs being ruled by Mercury can tend to overthink things: getting lost in their minds and may not be genuinely in touch with the outside world. Their interests are usually very similar with both wanting to read constantly, learn new information, and discuss what is on their minds together.",

Gemini and Virgo are both ruled by the planet Mercury which makes them very cerebral and mentally focused. Together, this brings out their psychological as well as communicative sides. This is a teachable relationship in which both parties must come to a mutual understanding and acceptance of one another. Virgo is likely going to seem a little bit too serious for Gemini, and it’s no doubt that balance is what is needed to make this relationship work.",

They only have eyes for each other and tend to get lost in their own world together. Cancer is able to bring out Virgo’s more imaginative side and therefore this couple never gets bored together. Virgo’s mutable, or changeable nature is a good match for Cancer’s cardinal, leading energy. They each will be more willing to head out and do things together out in the world because they feel understood and more free to be themselves when together. Intimacy comes easily, they almost fall in love at first sight. Cancer will be the one to push for sex, which Virgo may be shy about at first, but easily warms up with emotionally supportive Cancer.

Their interest will be varied and they find they have so much in common from music, favorite foods, movies, art, and literature: the usually quiet Virgo can’t stop talking. This union is made up of deeply rooted principles and common sense. Both value honesty, hard work, and process. Virgo should be aware though that they could hurt their Cancer partner from time to time if they become too critical and analytical of them. Virgo will always feel loved and nurtured by their Cancer partner and they both have a heart of service and helping.

In addition, their modalities are different with Leo being fixed and Virgo mutable.

Virgo will be more open to changing dynamics, who is in what role, and so on, while Leo will want things a certain way and for them to stay that way. Leo actually struggles with change a lot more than Virgo does. Sex for Virgo and Leo tends to be a bit off. They are both amazing lovers...just not always with each other. They each have a different idea of how sex should go, who should be on top, when to have it, etc. This can lead to a mismatch in the bedroom. If they work hard to get along and have a sense of humor then intimacy can build and maybe this relationship can work.",

Virgo can learn to be more spontaneous, and Leo will learn from Virgo the need to take a break and focus in a way that not only channels but builds their intellectual energy. Virgo, as an earth sign, will also teach Leo, a fire sign, to be more sensitive to other people’s needs, and Virgo can learn to loosen up a little bit. In general, Virgo and Leo value different things in life, aside from excellent conversation and varied interests. Leo is more concerned with developing an individual identity where Virgo is more concerned with helping and being of service to others, as their archetype would imply. The symbol for Leo, the lion, demonstrates their obvious leadership skills while Virgo, as the symbol of the maiden, is more subtle, but still an excellent leader. Both will need to find a balance in friendship, business, or love on who is going to get their way and who will have to compromise.",

They want both partners to give equally which tends to be a bad match for Virgo’s natural tendencies in bed. As sexual chemistry is lacking the spark just isn’t there.

            "love_description": "The two signs need emotional security from each other, and this makes them extremely loyal to each other. Virgo’s straightforwardness can complement Scorpio’s deep emotions. Virgo is a mutable sign and Scorpio is a fixed sign. Therefore, Virgo will help to pull up the Scorpio in realizing their full potential. Virgo being a mutable sign will easily adapt to Scorpio’s manipulative attitudes and refuse to pick fights making them well-balanced. Sex for them is high strung and explosive as a result. Their controlling energy seems to get released when they get into bed together. This makes intimacy between them deeply trusting, close, and emotionally fulfilling. Scorpio, as the symbol of the scorpion, will not be afraid to call out Virgo if they are being too picky or setting expectations that are too high Overall, this is a combination of signs that understands each other well and can connect through body, mind, and soul.",
            "values_description": "This relationship is a learning experience for both signs, one to be like the other. Virgo is ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication, and Scorpio by Mars, the planet of driver and Pluto, the planet of slow change and transformation. The result is a fiery love affair with energies that attract one another. They value each other’s intense minds and perspectives. Together Scorpio and Virgo find they actually have a similar way of approaching life, with Virgo’s more uptight earth energy and Scorpios fixed or stubborn modality. In addition, this gives them a mutual understanding of each other’s compulsions and habits. Together, they want everything just so and find this is complimentary much of the time. Both are extremely dedicated workers and can make their dreams and desires in life reality, especially when they are each other’s allies.",
            "overall_description": "When you bring Virgo and Scorpio together in a love match, you have something peculiar. This couple has a different kind of bond. Usually wanting to be away from the public eye, these two like to keep things just between them. They have a loyal connection with each other. Both want something from the relationship: Virgo someone to refine while Scorpio desires power. This makes them somewhat dramatic but overall gives them an outlet for their pressurized energy. They don’t fancy parties or outings but will work to tighten their secluded, special bond",

Virgo, as mutable earth, wants their partner to put energy towards building security together and defining relationship boundaries while Sagittarius, as mutable fire, wants to move around a lot and keep life constantly changing. Although Virgo might not be the one to take risks, Sagittarius will push things with vigor until they see their aim accomplished. This can be exciting for Virgo who enjoys having someone motivate them to go outside their comfort zone every once in a while! Sex is a different story, and Virgo will not really be into Sagittarius’ sexual prowess and energy. However, if they do find the sexual chemistry is there then sex can be something they both enjoy together, it is just not mind-blowing. The sign of the centaur, Sagittarius, is wily enough to keep things exciting while Virgo the sign of the maiden, brings refinement and attentiveness to sex that works for both of them. Fire and earth in love are very physically focused, passionate, and sometimes very intense.",

While Sagittarius is a peppy explorer, bubbling with energy and always wanting to test the waters and see for themselves how things will turn out. Virgo tends to keep their counterpart in check and give security so as to stay grounded. Sagittarius will add sparks to Virgo’s day, bringing excitement and a little bit of carefree energy. Virgo is ruled by Mercury which is quite the communicator while Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter which appeals to their needs for higher learning and travel. They are great communicators which help to bring endless conversations of substance between the two. They amuse each other endlessly and tend to make okay friends",
            "overall_description": "As these two differ entirely from the other, their adaptability is their greatest strength. Their combined effort to be better for each other comes easy for they are both mutable. While Virgo is analytical, Sagittarius is a social explorer. Their signs make a square aspect to each other on the zodiacal wheel. This means the relationship between a Sagittarius and a Virgo is set for growth and an intense dynamic. Both have similar energy levels but different ways of expressing it as their elements reveal. With Virgo being an earth sign they will take the more practical and realistic approach to life while Sagittarius, as a fire sign, will be more freedom-loving and wild. Together they can make this work as thinking and philosophizing are things both of them enjoy but their different approaches to life can have them going in totally opposite directions at other times.",

Virgo who is a naturally hard worker will be able to balance the home and work front easily. As the pair are goal-oriented they would help each other balance long hours of work with family time to give themselves the lives they know they truly want. When two earth signs get together they tend to make an amazing, strong, and supportive couple. Both encourage each other to pursue their interests and dreams while also being willing to put in the hard work to make them manifest. This relationship has an element of karma to it and these signs have a lot to learn from each other while also harmoniously being drawn together by a sense of fate or destiny. Intimacy between them is easy. The sign of the goat, Capricorn, gets the more subtle sexual energy of Virgo to come out. They are sensual as earth signs and Capricorn may tend to be more dominant in love, which Virgo doesn’t mind.

Virgo is a go-getter and hard worker just like Saturn ruled Capricorn, they will both understand each other’s desires to perfect and crystallize their wants and desires in this lifetime. They both value life in raw form, are highly physical, and apply a practical approach in dealing with what life throws at them. Virgo can also learn to be deeply intuitive from Capricorn, who contemplates life and is introspective about many things. The communicative and practical energies Virgo gets from Mercury will mix quite well with the cooling energy provided by Saturn through Capricorn.",

The pair have high expectations for one another and the relationship but both appreciate this, so it works out okay. Virgo can relate to Capricorn on levels of intensity and passion. Virgo's intuition appeals to their Capricorn lover deeply. Being both realists, they have a very intelligent and pragmatic view of life and the world at large. In this mind stance, both signs are to be careful and not to let their impulses get in the way. Virgo is ruled by Mercury which helps them think deeply and quickly while Capricorn is ruled by Saturn which makes them interested in gaining knowledge and mastering skills. Together these qualities are complementary and both signs enjoy learning, discussing, and exploring each other’s minds and souls.",

Since Aquarius is a fixed sign they will tend to be stubborn and want things to go their way, Virgo on the other hand also wants things to be just so, and is famous for their desire to meticulously orchestrate and manage situations. A relationship can find a strain with this constant energy to control. The air element of Aquarius means they are more emotionally detached while Virgo as an earth sign is more clued into how emotions affect the physical body and mood overall. They want to be constantly improving and setting health and wellness goals, which Aquarius may not be supportive of. Virgos’ accommodating nature will help to solve issues in this affair. Virgo probably sees Aquarius as irresponsible, as their unpredictable Uranian energy bleeds through, but will learn to love them either way. Sex for them is uncomfortable, neither one is able to connect with the other. Virgo needs to feel comfortable with their lover and Aquarius struggles to open up to Virgo’s sensitive nature about sex. They have different needs and desires in the bedroom, along with unmatching sex drives. If this pair can merge energies, they will do amazing things together, but willingness is a big issue.",
            "values_description": "Virgo's systematic approach to life will balance out Aquarius' passionate views. As an earth sign, Virgo is more organized and grounds Aquarius’ haphazard thinking and approach to life generally. Virgo is more of an intellectual while the Aquarian is more of a spiritual liberalist. Virgo takes life more seriously than the Aquarian. The pair may find it difficult to share each other's views, and this may cause conflicts to arise in the relationship. Partners must be able to tolerate one another's unique qualities to make this relationship work. The pair also values intelligence and could spur each other to build on intellectual strengths. As a sign ruled by Mercury, Virgo is keyed into the details and will tend to prioritize this above all else. Aquarius, a sign ruled by Uranus, is a big-picture thinker and less concerned with details. However, they both have powerful minds and leverage this to win debates and open up each other’s perceptions.",

Mutable signs are helpful, flexible, and will change their mood to suit a situation instead of expecting a situation to change to suit them. They usually have different life aspirations, and this is where merging energies is so important for them. Pisces value an artistic and soulful experience, as the sign of the oceanic and dreamy fish, while Virgo as the sign of the pragmatic virgin, will take a more practical or realistic approach to realize their dreams. In the end, Virgo will know that neither approach is better than the other, and will see Pisces as unique and beautiful in their own way.",

Despite being in polarity, they strive to be in unison with one another. It’s safe to say this pair understands the value of balance!
